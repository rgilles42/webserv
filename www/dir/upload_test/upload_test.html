      <div>
         <p>Select text file to upload to the store path specified in the configuration:</p>
         <input type="file" name="fileToUpload" id="fileToUpload">

            After uploading a file, you can delete the uploaded files with the DELETE http method, as long as the route allows it.
            <br>
            Unfortunately, as of the current HTML RFC, a DELETE form is very much a non-standard thing, so deleting a file within a strictly static HTML site is a no-go.
            <br>
            You will have to send the HTTP DELETE request directly, for instance with the command: <b>curl -v -X DELETE 127.0.0.1:8080/uploads/<i>your_file</i></b>
         </p>
